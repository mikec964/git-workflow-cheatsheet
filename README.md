# Git Workflow Cheatsheet

This worksheet is organized around a feature branch workflow.

The other cheatsheets I'd seen were organized into basic and advanced
commands but around particular steps in a process. I hope this is more
helpful by guiding you to the commands needed in context.

I drew heavily from 'Git in Practice' by Mike McQuaid, published by Manning
Publications. I highly recommend it.

## Applications Used
I used two Mac OS apps to create the cheet sheet.

The main layout (the .spub file) was done with Swift Publisher 5.0, 
published by Belight Software. www.belightsoft.com

The diagrams (the .sdxml file) were done with SimpleDiagram4, published
by McQuillen Interactive. www.simplediagrams.com
